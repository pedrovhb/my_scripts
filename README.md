These are personal scripts I built and use day to day.

I'm still porting them over into this repo from a less elegant binary management
philosophy. I had been using a script I made that gets all Python files in a
directory, adds a venv shebang to each, strips the .py extension, and moves them
to a dir that's on my PATH. pipx and poetry are obviously much nicer!
